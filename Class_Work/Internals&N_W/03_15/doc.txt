********Context Switching*****
Shifting of CPU from one running process to another which is ready to get executed.

Kernel transfers Cpu to other process which is ready to execute, before that it has process.
									Kernel saves the context of process 1
Now, kernel loads the context of new process p2 and executes the process.

After termination of new process, the process from which CPU was taken off will resume from where it left.
